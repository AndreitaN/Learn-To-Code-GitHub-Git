- Install the Atom text editor if you don't have a text editor. Go here: https://atom.io/
- Install Google Chrome (any browser will do, but Chrome can do some cool things): https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/

##### Prerequisites:
None, but it would be helpful to have previously completed our HTML and CSS workshops.

## Setting Up Your Computer
Before we begin, you need to make sure that the following is set up on your computer:
- Git Bash - To serve as our command prompt and terminal
- A GitHub account - To sync your work locally with an online repo
- GitHub Desktop - A GUI version of syncing your work online
- Atom text editor - our text editor of choice for Learn to Code
- Google Chrome - our web browser of choice for element inspection
Use the links under "How to Prepare:" to set these apps up. This may take some time...
Don't be afraid to ask for help. we'll get through it!

## Pushing and Pulling in Git

#### Config your Git
First step we need to do is configure your computer so that Git know who is making changes.
Open up your Git Bash and enter in the following commands:
```
$ git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
```
Now set your email:
```
$ git config --global user.email "<youremail@example.com>"
```
Your computer is now configured to you and your email address.
